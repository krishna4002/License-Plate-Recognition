# üöò License-Plate-Recognition

This is a **real-time AI-based application** built to **detect and recognize license plates** from images, uploaded videos, or a live webcam feed.

It uses:

* **YOLOv5** for detecting license plates,
* **EasyOCR** to extract text from detected plates,
* **Streamlit** for a simple and clean interactive user interface.

> This project can be used for traffic analysis, smart parking, toll booth automation, and vehicle monitoring in Indian cities.

## ‚öô Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repo and Install Dependencies

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-recognition
cd license-plate-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2. Clone the YOLOv5 GitHub Repo

bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5


Make sure it's inside your project folder.

---

### 3. Download and Train or Use Pretrained Indian Dataset

Use Roboflow dataset for Indian license plates:

python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
project = rf.workspace("roboflow-universe-projects").project("license-plate-recognition-rxg4e")
dataset = project.version(11).download("yolov5")


You can either train the model or directly use the provided best.pt weight file after training.

---

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

bash
streamlit run app.py


It will open an interactive UI in your browser.

## üìå How the System Works

1. *Detection*: The detect_plate.py script loads the trained YOLOv5 model and detects license plates from input frames.
2. *Recognition*: The recognize_text.py script uses EasyOCR to extract readable text from the plate region.
3. *Logging*: All detected plate numbers, along with their input source (image/video/webcam), are saved to a CSV file for future tracking or analysis.
4. *UI Interaction*: Streamlit allows the user to easily choose modes, upload files, and view results in real-time.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ FAQ

*Q: Will this work on Indian number plates?*
‚úÖ Yes. It is trained specifically on an Indian license plate dataset from Roboflow.

*Q: Can I use this system offline?*
‚úÖ Yes, once the model is trained and downloaded, the system does not require internet access.

*Q: Can I extend it to recognize car models or colors too?*
üí° Yes, you can expand the detection pipeline with more labels or integrate another YOLO model trained for vehicles.
